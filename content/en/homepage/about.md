[libsemigroups][] is a C++17 library containing implementations of several
algorithms for computing finite, and finitely presented, semigroups and
monoids. The main algorithms implemented in [libsemigroups][] are:

- the **Froidure-Pin** algorithm for computing semigroups and monoids defined
  by a generating set consisting of elements whose multiplication and equality is
  decidable;
- **Kambites'** algorithm for solving the word problem in small overlap monoids,
  and the algorithm for computing normal forms for small overlap monoids by the
  authors of [libsemigroups][];
- the **Knuth-Bendix** algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids;
- a version of **Sims'** low index subgroup algorithm for computing congruences of a
  semigroup or monoid;
- a generalized version of **Konieczny's** and **Lallement and Mcfadden's** algorithms;
- **Radoszewski and Rytter's** algorithm from testing equality of words in free
  bands;
- a non-random version of the **Schreier-Sims** algorithm;
- a version of **Stephen's** procedure from
  for finitely presented inverse semigroups and monoids;
- the **Todd-Coxeter** algorithm for finitely presented semigroups and monoids.
